o-charts_pi README
==================

This is a plugin for opencpn [1] providing support for encrypted charts
available from o-charts.org [2]. The plugin supports purchase, downloading
and rendering of these charts.

o-charts can handle charts which have been handled by the oesenc and oernc
plugins and thus obsoletes these plugins.

Building and installation is described in INSTALL.md

The plugin has a continous integration setup publishing artifacts
which can be used by the new opencpn plugin installer. See CI.md.
